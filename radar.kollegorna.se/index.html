          <p class="description">Crystal is a very powerful, static typing language which has the syntax of Ruby. This allows any Ruby developer to write fast, performant, (extremely) type safe code which means much less debugging time, less tests, better quality code and eventually less bugs for the client. I believe that Crystal is the right tool for small APIs that talk to external APIs. Things that you would need rb-dry or Virtus gems in Ruby, Crystal does it out of the box with types.</p>

At a time when RTB and ad exchanges were still nascent, Rocket Fuel quickly grew into the industry leader by bringing the precision and conclusiveness of science to the world of marketing to drive higher ROI.

  Today, Rocket Fuel is a full Programmatic Marketing Platform designed to go beyond 1:1 marketing by learning to predict what marketing actions to take with a particular person in a particular moment of time. Our methodology, which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, is called Moment Scoring™, and it results in a much more efficient use of marketing dollars.

  With Moment Scoring, we continue to define the next wave of data-driven marketing by optimizing programmatic marketing decisions across channels, devices, and objectives for agencies and marketers. The result is and will always be more efficient use of marketing dollars for a greater ROI.
  Programmatic technologies have evolved to reduce the complexity of reaching diverse audiences, but also make it possible to go beyond the traditional focus on audiences and segments to understand specific, relevant moments in consumers’ lives. Just a few years ago, marketing to moments was an exciting vision. With Rocket Fuel, it’s now a reality."

          data-description="Elixir is well known for its light-weight actor-based threads. Phoenix consumes much less memory than Rails, while being able to hold thousands of concurrent connections, even on an Heroku X1 dyno. I think the Rails ecosystem is really good due to its maturity, but Elixir with Phoenix would help us to deliver easier apps that have increased load. While in Rails we would use background workers to deliver sustainable response times, in Elixir we wouldn't have to worry as Phoenix spawns a new Erlang process for each request. Working with Rails remote forms, Sidekiq Workers and Pusher in rails is a pain in the ass. With Elixir, I believe we could skip this flow altogether and write regular views (and not .js views) which would make them easier to maintain and understand for new developers."

With the newest version of Foundation providing a simple yet more flexible approach, through the use of SASS mixins, we are ready to adopt it again as the _de facto_ grid framework."

  trying to solve marketer measurement problems outside of digital advertising, which sets them
  apart from competitors. To complement measurement, DataXu has put a lot of focus on crossdevice
  mapping, allowing marketers to import and export proprietary data and device graphs in
  and out of the DSP. Staying true to its open strategy, DataXu also allows marketers to customize
  machine learning with an algorithm marketplace and the ability to “bring your own algorithm.”
  DataXu doesn’t support campaign management in nonstandard systems, and it doesn’t show signs
  of adding this capability in the future. Additionally, while OneView gives marketers the opportunity
  for managing campaigns and reporting across devices, some marketers may opt for solutions that
  can authenticate users with login data."
