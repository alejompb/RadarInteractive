          data-description="Google Data Studio is a dashboard and reporting tool that is easy to use, customize, and share. It allows you to transform your data into appealing and informative reports for your audience. It’s a great tool to track KPIs that support business objectives and generate periodic reports. Right now, Data Studio beta is offered for free to Google account users and Google Cloud Platform customers.
          Data Studio is like Google Analytics dashboards on steroids. With Google Analytics dashboards, you are limited to 12 widgets per dashboard and can only connect to the data in the particular view the dashboard is in.
          When using Data Studio the user is not limited to just 12 widgets, it has the ability to add as many report pages as you would like, and it is possible to connect reports with multiple Google Analytics accounts and views.
          Compared to top business intelligence (BI) tools currently in the market (Tableau, Microsoft Power BI to name a few), Data Studio’s quality doesn’t compare. It doesn’t offer as wide of a range of capabilities and features as other BI tools.
          However, it’s a very user friendly tool with drag and drop features, connects easily with your Google Analytics data, and is as easy to share your work as other Google collaboration tools. If this is what you are looking for in a reporting tool, Data Studio may be the tool for you."

          data-description="Sketch has picked up an enormous after since it launched in 2009. It is truly useful and productive in the exploration and UX phase of the design procedure. It is a moderately new application and it was designed particularly for web and application interface format. It additionally offers some fascinating elements, e.g. CSS export. And has very lightweight UI. The Sketch interface is generally simple to get used to, in any case, it has a surrey nature because of being so mark beating new. This can be a touch of irritating and tedious. On the off-chance that one has patience and a free due date, definitely, give Sketch a go! It has a mirror application accessible for mobile prototyping which is awesome for responsive design, however, this is fiddly to use and very frustrating at the cost you pay. Without having to manually add slices, Sketch can create assets using one-click export, which will be exported at 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 3x and in various formats such as PNG, JPG and TIFF."

Domo enables rapid deployment by leveraging its native cloud architecture, an extensive set of data connectors and prebuilt content, and an intuitive, modern user experience. Because Domo is primarily used by business people for management-style dashboards, and is often deployed in lines of business with little or no support from IT, a higher percentage of its customer references report using it primarily for decentralized use cases than is the case for most other vendors.
          During the past year, Domo formalized its channel program and launched developer.domo.com on a newly branded Domo Business Cloud platform and an Appstore for Domo and its ecosystem of partners to sell vetted Domo connectors and apps. Data as a service is on the roadmap, where
          Domo customers will be able to access, blend and analyze their enterprise data with external open and premium data. Domo also added a limited freemium offering with the option for a fully featured 60-day trial to give users a way to try before they buy and expand their use based on getting business value from the platform — a land-and-expand model supported by most other vendors in the market"

Tag-based solutions typically charge by the number of tag calls you make, even if those tags don’t end up being used. Tag-based solutions often require third-party cookies, which certain browsers or browser settings might not support, causing you to lose the ability to test a large percentage of traffic. Tag-based solutions can have imprecise reporting because the javascript doesn’t always fire. While this value proposition won’t be the deciding factor for many businesses, for those requiring a server-side solution, SiteSpect is one of the best options on the market."

As the A/B tests are defined in code, there is no setup or configuration required, the first time code for a particular test executes, it does all the setup work for the test and logs the first participant. Subsequent test alternatives are read straight from the cache. Each A/B test is defined in controllers (or views), and A/Bingo also allows for multivariate testing, with the ability to build your own dashboard or use the default one provided to view the results of your tests. It's simple to setup, simple install the plugin, create the required tables, assign the user a unique identifying string and configure the cache."

You can also include KISSmetrics into your in-house testing code, or integrate it with another A/B testing platform. Once you've set up your test you can then segment any report to see the test's performance, and determine if the results are significant.

          data-description="Affinity by Serif has been named the ‘Photoshop killer’ by a few, and it is anything but difficult to see any reason why. Our initial introductions are that the application is incredibly very much composed and that it has an inclination that it has been made to be a devoted web and visual design tool. There were a couple of elements that I truly appreciated, including customisable nondestructive layers – which basically implies you can modify pictures or vectors without harming them. The 1,000,000 percent zoom was simply ecstasy (all the time Photoshop’s 32,000 feels like it’s sufficiently not). This is particularly helpful when working with vector art, as you can truly get in close. The Undo and history components are likewise truly helpful – Affinity permits you to go back more than 8,000 stages. With regards to designing, the UI feels commonplace. When moving from Photoshop, everybody appears to need to begin once again, which can represent a genuine test. What Affinity has done is kept the design well-known while fixing everything up and concealing diversions. I was effortlessly ready to bounce straight in and get designing. In general, Affinity feels like it could be a genuine competitor to Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch."

At a time when RTB and ad exchanges were still nascent, Rocket Fuel quickly grew into the industry leader by bringing the precision and conclusiveness of science to the world of marketing to drive higher ROI.

            Today, Rocket Fuel is a full Programmatic Marketing Platform designed to go beyond 1:1 marketing by learning to predict what marketing actions to take with a particular person in a particular moment of time. Our methodology, which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, is called Moment Scoring™, and it results in a much more efficient use of marketing dollars.

            With Moment Scoring, we continue to define the next wave of data-driven marketing by optimizing programmatic marketing decisions across channels, devices, and objectives for agencies and marketers. The result is and will always be more efficient use of marketing dollars for a greater ROI.
            Programmatic technologies have evolved to reduce the complexity of reaching diverse audiences, but also make it possible to go beyond the traditional focus on audiences and segments to understand specific, relevant moments in consumers’ lives. Just a few years ago, marketing to moments was an exciting vision. With Rocket Fuel, it’s now a reality."
