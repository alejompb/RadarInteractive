          data-description="As a server-side testing solution, SiteSpect avoids many of the issues that can arise with the more typical browser-based testing platforms that utilize javascript tags. Tag-based solutions typically charge by the number of tag calls you make, even if those tags don’t end up being used. Tag-based solutions often require third-party cookies, which certain browsers or browser settings might not support, causing you to lose the ability to test a large percentage of traffic. Tag-based solutions can have imprecise reporting because the javascript doesn’t always fire. While this value proposition won’t be the deciding factor for many businesses, for those requiring a server-side solution, SiteSpect is one of the best options on the market."

          data-description="A/Bingo is a Ruby on Rails' A/B testing framework deployed as a plugin, which can test display or behavioral differences using just one line of code. It can measure any event, test for statistical significance and is extremely fast, meaning it has minimal impact on page load times or server load. As the A/B tests are defined in code, there is no setup or configuration required, the first time code for a particular test executes, it does all the setup work for the test and logs the first participant. Subsequent test alternatives are read straight from the cache. Each A/B test is defined in controllers (or views), and A/Bingo also allows for multivariate testing, with the ability to build your own dashboard or use the default one provided to view the results of your tests. It's simple to setup, simple install the plugin, create the required tables, assign the user a unique identifying string and configure the cache."

          data-description="KISSmetrics is a powerful analytics platform to help increase customer acquisition and retention rates. The KISSmetrics JavaScript library provides a function to help you set up your A/B test, which has three major features; it randomly assigns the current visitor to one of the variations, ensures the subsequent calls return the same variation to the visitor and sets a property with the name of the your experiment. You can also include KISSmetrics into your in-house testing code, or integrate it with another A/B testing platform. Once you've set up your test you can then segment any report to see the test's performance, and determine if the results are significant. You also have the ability to track two completely different page designs, not just changes in individual elements, using a single URL for all of your landing page variants."

  machine learning with an algorithm marketplace and the ability to “bring your own algorithm.”
  DataXu doesn’t support campaign management in nonstandard systems, and it doesn’t show signs
  of adding this capability in the future. Additionally, while OneView gives marketers the opportunity
  for managing campaigns and reporting across devices, some marketers may opt for solutions that

            data-description="Rocket Fuel was founded in March 2008 with a vision of transforming the digital advertising industry through big data and artificial intelligence. At a time when RTB and ad exchanges were still nascent, Rocket Fuel quickly grew into the industry leader by bringing the precision and conclusiveness of science to the world of marketing to drive higher ROI.

  Today, Rocket Fuel is a full Programmatic Marketing Platform designed to go beyond 1:1 marketing by learning to predict what marketing actions to take with a particular person in a particular moment of time. Our methodology, which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, is called Moment Scoring™, and it results in a much more efficient use of marketing dollars.

  With Moment Scoring, we continue to define the next wave of data-driven marketing by optimizing programmatic marketing decisions across channels, devices, and objectives for agencies and marketers. The result is and will always be more efficient use of marketing dollars for a greater ROI.
  Programmatic technologies have evolved to reduce the complexity of reaching diverse audiences, but also make it possible to go beyond the traditional focus on audiences and segments to understand specific, relevant moments in consumers’ lives. Just a few years ago, marketing to moments was an exciting vision. With Rocket Fuel, it’s now a reality."
